 Duckling is a new programming language currently under development. It combines the speed of compiled languages with the ease of use of scripting languages. This thesis introduces a Language Server for Duckling, aiming to improve the development experience for programmers. It includes descriptions of the implementation of key features, such as code completion and diagnostics.
