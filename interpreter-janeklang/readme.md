# Programming Language Interpreter

## Overview

This project includes an interpreter for a custom programming language designed as part of the JiPP course requirements. The interpreter is implemented in Haskell and supports a variety of programming constructs, error handling, and dynamic/static typing depending on the language design.

## Features

- Supports imperative programming paradigms.
- Dynamic execution and error handling, including runtime exceptions like division by zero.
- Custom syntax designed to demonstrate specific language features such as conditional statements, loops, and function calls.
- Optional static typing with type checks prior to execution.

## Installation

Ensure Haskell (version 9.0.2) is installed on your system. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.

```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd [project-directory]
```
