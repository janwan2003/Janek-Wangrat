## Introduction

Hello! I'm Jan Wangrat, a 21-year-old student pursuing dual Bachelor's degrees in Computer Science (2024) and Mathematics (2025) at the University of Warsaw. I'm also a Data Engineer and Software Developer at Neural Alpha, focusing on building an LLM powered platform with technologies like Python, Neo4j, MongoDB, LangChain, and S3.
